# Docker Compose Fixes

## Summary

Fixed critical issues discovered during GitHub Actions testing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Spark Image Not Found

**Error:**
```
manifest for bitnami/spark:3.5 not found: manifest unknown
```

**Root Cause:**
- Bitnami Spark image uses full version tags (3.5.0, not 3.5)
- Tag `3.5` doesn't exist in Bitnami registry

**Fix:**
Changed to official Apache Spark image:
```yaml
# Before
image: bitnami/spark:3.5

# After
image: apache/spark:3.5.0
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Official Apache image (more stable)
- ✅ Consistent with project philosophy
- ✅ Better long-term support
- ✅ Smaller image size

**Updated Configuration:**
```yaml
spark-master:
  image: apache/spark:3.5.0
  command: /opt/spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master
  environment:
    - SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=true

spark-worker:
  image: apache/spark:3.5.0
  command: /opt/spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://spark-master:7077
  environment:
    - SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=2G
    - SPARK_WORKER_CORES=2
    - SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=true
```

### 2. Obsolete Version Field

**Warning:**
```
the attribute `version` is obsolete, it will be ignored, please remove it to avoid potential confusion
```

**Root Cause:**
- Docker Compose V2 deprecated the `version` field
- It's now optional and ignored
- Causes warnings in CI/CD logs

**Fix:**
Removed version field:
```yaml
# Before
version: '3.8'

services:
  ...

# After
services:
  ...
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No warnings in logs
- ✅ Compatible with Compose V2
- ✅ Cleaner syntax
- ✅ Future-proof

---

## Testing

### Verified On

- ✅ Local development (Docker Desktop)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (Ubuntu 22.04)
- ✅ GitHub Actions (Ubuntu 20.04)

### Test Commands

```bash
# Pull images
docker compose pull

# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Check status
docker compose ps

# Verify Spark
curl http://localhost:8081

# Check logs
docker compose logs spark-master
docker compose logs spark-worker
```

---

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users

If you have the old version running:

```bash
# Stop old containers
docker compose down

# Pull new images
docker compose pull

# Start with new configuration
docker compose up -d

# Verify Spark is working
docker compose logs spark-master
docker compose logs spark-worker
```

**No data loss** - volumes are preserved.

## Image Comparison

### Bitnami vs Apache Official

| Aspect | Bitnami | Apache Official |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Source** | Third-party | Official Apache |
| **Size** | ~800 MB | ~600 MB |
| **Updates** | Bitnami schedule | Apache releases |
| **Configuration** | Env vars (easy) | Command-line (flexible) |
| **Support** | Community | Apache community |
| **Our Choice** | ❌ Removed | ✅ Using |

**Decision**: Apache official for better long-term stability and alignment with Apache ecosystem.

## Commands Changed

### Spark Master

**Before (Bitnami):**
```yaml
environment:
  SPARK_MODE: master
  SPARK_RPC_AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED: 'no'
  # ... more env vars
```

**After (Apache):**
```yaml
command: /opt/spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master
environment:
  - SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=true
```

### Spark Worker

**Before (Bitnami):**
```yaml
environment:
  SPARK_MODE: worker
  SPARK_MASTER_URL: spark://spark-master:7077
  SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY: 2G
  SPARK_WORKER_CORES: 2
```

**After (Apache):**
```yaml
command: /opt/spark/bin/spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://spark-master:7077
environment:
  - SPARK_WORKER_MEMORY=2G
  - SPARK_WORKER_CORES=2
  - SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=true
```

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Breaking Changes

**None!**

The service names, ports, and volumes remain the same:
- ✅ Port 8081 (Spark UI)
- ✅ Port 7077 (Spark master)
- ✅ Volume mounts unchanged
- ✅ Network connectivity unchanged

**Airflow DAGs** continue to work without modification.

---

## Future Improvements

### Consider Adding

1. **Health Checks**
   ```yaml
   spark-master:
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080"]
       interval: 30s
       timeout: 10s
       retries: 3
   ```

2. **Resource Limits**
   ```yaml
   spark-worker:
     deploy:
       resources:
         limits:
           cpus: '2'
           memory: 2G
   ```

3. **Restart Policy**
   ```yaml
   spark-master:
     restart: unless-stopped
   ```

## Verification Checklist

After updating docker-compose.yml:

- [x] Images pull successfully
- [x] Spark master starts
- [x] Spark worker connects to master
- [x] Spark UI accessible (port 8081)
- [x] No warnings in compose logs
- [x] Existing volumes work
- [x] Airflow can submit Spark jobs
- [x] Tests pass on GitHub Actions

## Files Modified

1. `docker-compose.yml` - Main changes
2. `docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_FIXES.md` - This file
3. `.github/workflows/test-local-setup.yml` - Already compatible

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always pin versions** - Use full version tags (3.5.0, not 3.5)
2. **Test in CI** - GitHub Actions caught this immediately
3. **Use official images** - More reliable long-term
4. **Remove deprecated fields** - Keep configs clean

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and tested

All Docker Compose issues resolved. Platform now runs successfully on GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners.
