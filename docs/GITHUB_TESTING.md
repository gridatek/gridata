# GitHub Actions - Linux Local Setup Testing

## Overview

Automated testing of Gridata local setup on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu runners to ensure the platform works on fresh Linux installations.

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/test-local-setup.yml`

---

## What Gets Tested

### Test Matrix

| Job | Runner | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| **test-ubuntu-latest** | ubuntu-latest (22.04) | Full integration test |
| **test-ubuntu-20-04** | ubuntu-20.04 | Backward compatibility |
| **test-makefile-commands** | ubuntu-latest | Makefile command validation |

### Test Coverage

#### 1. Ubuntu Latest (Full Test)
- ✅ Docker and Docker Compose installation
- ✅ All 10 services start successfully
- ✅ Service health checks (MinIO, Airflow, Spark, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch)
- ✅ Sample data generation
- ✅ Data upload to MinIO
- ✅ 30+ automated health checks via `test-local-setup.sh`
- ✅ Airflow DAGs loaded
- ✅ MinIO buckets created
- ✅ Spark worker connectivity

#### 2. Ubuntu 20.04 (Compatibility Test)
- ✅ Docker Compose V2 installation
- ✅ Services start successfully
- ✅ Basic health checks (MinIO, Airflow)

#### 3. Makefile Commands (Command Validation)
- ✅ `make local-up` workflow
- ✅ `make local-test` execution
- ✅ `make local-down` cleanup
- ✅ `make local-clean` full cleanup

## Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

1. **Push to main/develop**
   - When docker-compose.yml changes
   - When setup scripts change
   - When test scripts change
   - When sample data generator changes

2. **Pull Requests**
   - Against main or develop branches
   - Same file filters as push

3. **Scheduled**
   - Weekly on Mondays at 6 AM UTC
   - Ensures ongoing compatibility

### Manual Trigger

- **workflow_dispatch**: Can be manually triggered from GitHub Actions UI

---

## Test Steps (Ubuntu Latest)

### 1. Environment Setup
```yaml
- Checkout code
- Free up disk space (~10GB recovered)
- Set up Docker Buildx
- Install Python 3, curl, jq
```

### 2. Start Services
```yaml
- Make scripts executable
- Create required directories
- Run docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Wait for Health (10-minute timeout)
```yaml
- Poll MinIO health endpoint (30 attempts, 10s interval)
- Poll PostgreSQL readiness (30 attempts, 10s interval)
- Poll Airflow health endpoint (60 attempts, 10s interval)
```

### 4. Generate & Upload Data
```yaml
- Install Python dependencies (faker, pandas, pyarrow)
- Generate sample e-commerce data
- Upload to MinIO using mc client
```

### 5. Run Tests
```yaml
- Execute test-local-setup.sh (30+ checks)
- Test Airflow DAGs loaded
- Test MinIO buckets accessible
- Test Spark connectivity
```

### 6. Cleanup
```yaml
- docker compose down -v
- docker system prune -f
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Disk Space Management

GitHub runners have ~14GB available disk space. The workflow frees up ~10GB by removing:
- .NET SDK (~2GB)
- Android SDK (~3GB)
- GHC (~1GB)
- Old Docker images (~4GB)

### Parallel Execution

Three jobs run in parallel:
- ubuntu-latest (10-15 minutes)
- ubuntu-20.04 (5-8 minutes)
- makefile-commands (3-5 minutes)

### Timeouts

- Service health checks: 10-minute timeout
- Overall workflow: 60-minute timeout (default)

---

## Success Criteria

### All Jobs Must Pass

1. ✅ All Docker containers start
2. ✅ All health checks pass
3. ✅ Sample data generates successfully
4. ✅ Data uploads to MinIO
5. ✅ Automated test script exits with code 0
6. ✅ Airflow DAGs are loaded
7. ✅ MinIO buckets exist
8. ✅ Spark worker connects to master

### Summary Job

Final job checks all results:
- If all pass → ✅ Workflow succeeds
- If any fail → ❌ Workflow fails with details

## Viewing Test Results

### GitHub UI

1. Go to repository → **Actions** tab
2. Select **Test Local Setup (Linux)** workflow
3. View recent runs and their status
4. Click on a run to see detailed logs

### Status Badge

Add to README.md:
```markdown
[![Test Local Setup](https://github.com/your-org/gridata/workflows/Test%20Local%20Setup%20(Linux)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/gridata/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Test+Local+Setup+%28Linux%29%22)
```

## Troubleshooting Failed Tests

### Common Failures

#### 1. Service Health Timeout

**Error**: "Waiting for service timed out"

**Causes**:
- Service took too long to start
- Service crashed during startup
- Health check endpoint incorrect

**Check**:
- View logs in "View service logs on failure" step
- Look for error messages in service logs

#### 2. Disk Space Issues

**Error**: "No space left on device"

**Solution**:
- Workflow already frees up 10GB
- If still failing, reduce service sizes in docker-compose.yml
- Remove Elasticsearch from test (large memory footprint)

#### 3. Sample Data Generation Failure

**Error**: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'faker'"

**Solution**:
- Check pip install step completed
- Verify Python 3 is available

#### 4. Docker Compose Not Found

**Error**: "docker compose: command not found"

**Solution**:
- Ubuntu 20.04 job installs Docker Compose V2
- Check installation step completed

## Local Replication

To replicate GitHub Actions tests locally:

```bash
# Use same Ubuntu version
docker run -it ubuntu:22.04 bash

# Inside container
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git docker.io python3 python3-pip curl

# Clone and test
git clone https://github.com/your-org/gridata.git
cd gridata
./scripts/setup-local-env.sh
./scripts/test-local-setup.sh
```

---

## Workflow Maintenance

### When to Update

Update `.github/workflows/test-local-setup.yml` when:
- Docker Compose file changes significantly
- New services added
- Setup scripts modified
- New Linux distributions to test
- GitHub runner images updated

### Version Pinning

Currently using:
- `ubuntu-latest` (22.04 as of 2024)
- `ubuntu-20.04` (for compatibility)
- `actions/checkout@v3`
- `docker/setup-buildx-action@v2`
